#Starter
Starter boilerplate made by Pawel Grzybek (www.studiorgb.uk). Build with SASS and Gulp. Foundation grid system (medified) attached.

##How to use it?
Thats very easy. First you need to care about few things. Ruby, npm and gulp. Ruby comes preinstalled on Mac OS X. If you are on Windows machine go on Ruby website and download an installer. To install npm (node packages manager) you need to install node on your machine. Simply just download an installation package from node website and enjoy. Gulp is easy. To install this component open your terminal and type 


## To do
Process of building perfect boilerplaite that suits your requirements is endless. Here are the things what im planing to implement shortly:
- modify grid system to more semantic without classes dependencies
- add source maps to sass
- add forms to global.scss
- add more typography examples to global.scss
- global which works fine with gulp would be awesome
- add gulp-svgo to it
- add hr to typography.scss
- add gulp-imagemin
