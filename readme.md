#Starter
Starter boilerplate made by Pawel Grzybek (www.studiorgb.uk). Build with SASS and Gulp. Foundation grid system (medified) attached.

## To do:
- add source maps to sass
- add forms to global.scss
- add more typography examples to global.scss
- global which works fine with gulp would be awesome
- add gulp-svgo to it
- add hr to typography.scss
